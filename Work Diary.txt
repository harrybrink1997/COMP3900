Work Diary - z5117928

Week 1:

Grouped formed. I created a Jira account and
joined both the Jira and Github groups. Together with Nanway I
worked on the epic stories and individual user stories. I also discussed
with the team what project features we wanted to have in the project,
what the projected outcome will look like and the APIs we might use
in the final product.

Week 2:
Group furthered development of project. A MVP was proposed and voted
on by group. I research similar software to ours and analysed 
the good things and draw backs of the software. I wrote the problem
statement and current technology as well as software description
for a proposal report due end of next week.
